A machine learning project for gender classification from facial images using Perceptron and SVM. Trained on a dataset of 2,307 images, both models achieved ~90% accuracy on test data. The project implements comprehensive feature extraction (RGB analysis, HOG, GLCM, and more) and an interactive GUI application for real-world testing on any image.
